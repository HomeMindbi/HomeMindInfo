                HomeMind is designed for homeowners and renters who want to protect the value of their
                belongings. Most people don’t realize how much proof insurance companies require until it’s too
                late. With HomeMind, you’ll be prepared ahead of time with the documentation needed to
                ensure your insurance claims are properly supported.

            <h2 class="section-title">Why It Matters</h2>
            <div class="paragraph">
                Insurance companies are notorious for trying to reduce payouts, especially when there's little
                documentation to prove the value of your belongings. HomeMind is a security measure for you,
                ensuring that your valuables are accurately recorded before any unfortunate events, like natural
                disasters or home damage.

            <h2 class="section-title">How HomeMind Helps</h2>
            <div class="paragraph">
                In just a few minutes, you can have an entire catalog of your belongings, excluding items like
                jewelry or fine art that require appraisals. HomeMind’s AI is incredibly efficient at recognizing
                and listing everyday items—even when they’re cluttered. It can read brand names and titles on
                objects like books, helping you keep track of everything with incredible accuracy.
